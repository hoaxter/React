React is a library
-> framework vs library
-> React is a SPA(Single Page Application it does not reload)

# Topics to learn 
- core of react (state or UI manipulation, JSX)
- component reusability
- Reusing of component (props)
- how to propogate change (hooks)

# Additional Addon to React
- Router (React don't have Router)
- State Management (React don't have state management)
    -> Redux, Redux toolkit, Context API
- class based component
    -> legacy code
- BAAS  Apps (eg. firebase, supabase)
    -> social mdeia clone, e-commerce app ...

# After React 
-> React is not a complete solution in most case
    -> NO SEO , browser Render of JS, no routing
-> Framework: NEXT JS, GATSBY, REMIX


React---> React-dom (for web)
  |______> React-native (for mobile)

abbreviations
npm: node package manager (to install node packages)
npx: node package executer (it executes without installing packages)

npm (Node Package Manager):
Used to install, update, and manage Node.js packages for a project or globally.
It maintains dependencies using package.json and stores them in node_modules.

npx (Node Package Executor):
Used to run Node.js packages directly without installing them globally.
It executes packages temporarily, making it ideal for one-time or CLI commands.

1> Creating react with create-react-app 01basicreact (another way but its very bulky utility that's why we prefer vite)
2> The starting reading point of react is the package.json file.
3> see name of project, version, the dependencies are given and also testing libraries for testing purpose
  - react scripts, web vitals for analyzing the performance
  - scripts are the one that run project and make them ready
  - eslint show more better
4> npm run start will run the project (we can use directly npm start but their lies an exception so we prefer using npm run start)
5> most of the time we will working in src so we can delete the files that are of no Use
  - setupTest.js delete
  - reportWebVitals.js
  - other than app.js, index.js we can delete all the files
  - now clean the App.js and index.js file removing the comments
6> The js file will be injected into the html file , if not the js will not run, so why we can't see it injected cause in create-react-app 
    -> react-script make inject the index.js , you can find the react-script in pkg and if you inspect the project after running you can see in src code that script is added.
7> <App/> is not a defualt tag but but a cutom tag, so react allow us to create custom tag
8> <React.StrictMode> <App /></React.StrictMode>
    -> we can run even without strictmode (it is a safe mode)
7> We create a component name nitin.js and export it to the App.js (we can create components other than App.js) 
8> While creating Components , the file dosent need to have a first letter capital but the function inside it need to have a first letter capital 
    -> eg. Filename: nitin.js , function name: function Nitin(){return(<h2>hi</h2>)}
9> We can create a different component and export its function directly to the index.js or we can import it into another component. We can create multiple function in a component.
   -> We can import component with different name from their function defined name and exported name until the first letter is capital.


1> creating a project using vite (vite is a bundler)
  - npm create vite@latest 
  - npm i (for installing node_modules)
2> clean the project 
3> run the project using npm run dev (as in the package.json the dev is used for running the project)
4> JS will be injected in the html file, in vite it is injected without injection the js will not work.
5> <App/> is not a defualt tag but but a cutom tag, so react allow us to create custom tag
    -> so what App is acutally, its a function that returns html and we exported it and we rendered the App function.
6> <React.StrictMode> <App /></React.StrictMode>
    -> we can run even without strictmode (it is a safemode)
7> We create a component name nitin.jsx and export it to the App.jsx (we can create components other than App.jsx) 
8> While creating Components , the file dosent need to have a first letter capital but the function inside it need to have a first letter capital 
    -> eg. Filename: nitin.jsx , function name: function Nitin(){return(<h2>hi</h2>)}
9> We can create a different component and export its function directly to the index.jsx or we can import it into another component. We can create multiple function in a component.
   -> We can import component with different name from their function defined name and exported name until the first letter is capital.
